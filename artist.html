			<p class="small-quote">Meet the Architect’s Artist. Wasel has partnered with some of the biggest brands and largest real estate development companies in the world to create collaborative art pieces for public works and private clients, including Nissan, CapitaLand, Formula 1, and the Burj Khalifa, world’s tallest building.

			<h2 class="sub-title">In Converstion with Wasel</h2>
			<h3 class="writer">By Melissa Du Shane</h3>
			<p class="text">Wasel Choi has big doe eyes and a gentle demeanor. When I look into his eyes as I’m asking questions, it leaves me thinking that he has an aura of wonderment like I feel like I’ve probably only ever seen in young kids. I know him professionally as my client and personally as my colleague’s husband – also as a man who his way around a barbecue. He’s prone to listening intently to my questions and interjecting with, “First, I need to tell you a story.” Sometimes, he answers the question. Sometimes, the story goes in an entirely new direction. Other times, I forget the question I originally asked and settle on where we’ve landed in the conversation.<br>
			<br>There’s just something pure yet impenetrable in great artworks that leave them open to interpretation in a way you can never exactly put your finger on; it’s definitely not a straight line (and his work has seriously straight lines). Wasel’s work has that quality for me. I can’t say I always understand what’s going on in Wasel’s head that enables him to do what he does, but it’s always fascinating. Here’s what he had to say when I sat down with him.</p>
			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="writer">Q & A</h3>
				<ul class="questions">
					<li><em class="md">Melissa Du Shane:</em> Why the Architect’s Artist?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel Choi:</em> In my heart, I always connected the two. Art I’ve always been doing since I was a kid. As an adult, I got my BA in architectural engineering. I started practicing art full time in 2003, and I was selected for Art Paris when I was like 26-years-old.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em> What is it you love about being commissioned to create artworks for specific spaces? 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em> There’s three levels of seeing, there’s the way I see it. The way you see it. The way you see it in a space.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>You’ve been profiled on the BBC and spoken at TedX, you’re famous for founding an art movement called UAEism. When I see press clippings, you’re known as Wasel Safwan? 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>For me as an artist, my name marks periods. I'm developing what I started when I ended UAEism and my last name was "Safwan."</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Try telling Google that. How did your name evolve?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>It was Wasel Safwan in Abu Dhabi. It was Wasel Safwan-Choi in Singapore. In the United States, it's Wasel Choi, which is my wife’s name. I told her after we got married that I wanted to take her name. It’s a family decision. I asked my wife’s father if I could use it. He said, if you take care of my daughter then you have my blessing. </p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>I love the photo of the giant painting in front of the mountain. Were you trying to set the World's Record for longest painting? 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>That was for the Zafco world headquarters. The interior designer wanted a number of paintings, but they had to be seamless in appearance. And I kept thinking what could I do? So I painted the entire canvas, which came from a tent supply store because I couldn’t get one long at the art store, then cut it up into six paintings. Before I did that though, I took the painting out to the desert and had it photographed.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Your work is a lot about the subconscious?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>It's really something mysterious, and I'm sure many artists share that in common. I strongly believe in subconscious work. Anything in my work comes from that moment.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa:</em>Do you sketch your paintings first or make any studies? 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel Choi:</em>“No sketch. Just pure right away. It’s immediate and coming from the subconscious. One moment it’s there, then it's gone.” </P>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa:</em>A little birdy told me you sleep next to your paintings at night? And by “a little birdy,” I mean your beautiful wife Rosa.
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel Choi:</em>“Yeah, I like to do that. I don’t do it all the time. But sometimes I take my pillow and sleep next to the painting. I have this habit before even meeting Rosa, that I like being by my work. These are my babies. I would do anything for them.” </p>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa:</em>Do you feel like you can’t stop working and need to keep going til it’s finished? 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel Choi:</em>“It’s not something exactly like that. It’s more like waves and feelings. I want to be next to them. Even though my paintings are not gonna talk to me.” </p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Seems like they might be talking to you.  
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>I mean there’s no voice coming from the painting!</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>But you sleep with them?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>Yes, I sleep near the paintings, and hope they talk! (Laughs
						)</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>You hope! You're not saying they actually do talk?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>They don't talk. They give that kind off waves, and that touches me very much. It’s a feeling I got from being near the painting.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>So, it's a feeling? 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>It's only about feelings.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>We know they're not actually talking. We don't need to call anyone?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>No… I don't think so.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Are you sure Rosa doesn’t snore?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>No, but I do.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Good to know. And I could talk about sleeping with paintings all day, but let’s delve into a new topic. Tell me about living in the Bay Area. Does it inspire you?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>Oh my gosh, yes! The geography of the Bay Area gives me inspiration to be an artist.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>How does nature play into your work?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>When you look at the horizon, how many shapes do you see? When painting, I look to nature for inspiration. I see not only distinct shapes like squares and circles, but also a chaos of abstracted, broken geometries.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>As we chat, I’m looking at your painting entitled "From The North," which I know was inspired by Marin. Do you see something when you look at it?  
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>No, I don't see anything from Marin, I see me, I see myself there. </p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>If I told you that I see a bunny in the middle part of the painting on the right side, would that be weird? “
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>Sometimes, people figure out shapes in my work. They think I really thought out what they see. They strongly believe it’s there, and they reveal a secret to me about my work. </p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Whew, that’s a relief. Because I really do see a gray bunny. So, you like it when people see things in your work? 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>Oh, yeah. Actually my work is not complete without that. I enjoy that very much. I've met many people who have started to figure out shapes through my work, and I feel like I'm in shock when they figure out what they see. They think that I really painted that figure. But for me, I appreciate looking at it through their eyes.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Was-sup?!!!!!!
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>When I arrived to America, the first person I spoke to was a security guard who saw my name was Wasel, he abbreviated it to ‘Was.’ He was like your name’s Was? Was-sup? Throughout my immigration, it’s been very smooth.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>How have you liked California so far?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>I love San Francisco. I feel something for this place. My heart starts to feel, there's something for me here. It feels very comfortable to me compared to other places.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Maybe it’s the cowboy hats you wear in a lot of your pictures?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>Maybe. But I love it! This place is very, very challenging. It’s all so new. Sometimes, I still feel like I'm still learning to live in this entirely new world.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa: </em>Last question, how do you know a work is finished?
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>Traditionally, if you've signed it, it's finished. But I don't know when I'm going to stop. Then I’m just done. The work is complete. </p>
					</li>
					<li><em class="md">Melissa:</em> I know when I’m going to stop, and it’s right here. Thank you for your time. 
						<p><em class="wc">Wasel: </em>Thank you.</p>
